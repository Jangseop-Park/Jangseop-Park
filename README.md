- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jangseop-Park
- 👀 I’m interested in using AI to transform mechanical engineering processes, with a focus on 3D deep learning, surrogate modeling, and data-driven design for efficient CAE.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced deep learning techniques, including Graph Neural Networks, PointNet, and Deep Operator Networks, to address challenges in nonlinear analysis and complex geometry handling.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve developing AI-driven tools for engineering design, especially those aimed at accelerating simulation and analysis processes in CAE.
